# CHALLENGE BACKEND - NodeJs-TypeScript-PostGresql-ExpressðŸš€

## Objective

A service order system needs to be built for a company that provides maintenance and installation services for TV brackets. Customers can make a service request by generating a ticket through the system, to which a token must be generated and a technician must be randomly assigned to attend the request.

Finally, technicians can see the assigned orders and it is necessary to have an endpoint that returns the technician's services in JSON format with the list.

## Installation
